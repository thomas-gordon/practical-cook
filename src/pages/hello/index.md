Hi! My name is Tom, an amateur cook and web developer professionally. Over the past 5 years I've been
carefully researching and using various cooking techniques and instruments, with a strong focus on
getting the best cooking processes down pat. 

The intent behind this site is to provide a series of lists and articles that goes through scientific approaches to cooking. I have little interest in tradition, I want
the best flavour!

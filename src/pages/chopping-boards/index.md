<h4>In summary...</h4>
<p>If you can afford it, get (Sani-Tuff rubber boards)[https://www.notrax.com/t45-sani-tuff]. Otherwise, get
bamboo or wood for all tasks.</p>

Prep work is a lot of cooking, at least in terms of time. If you enjoy the process of prepping using knives
and other board-centric tools, it's super important to get a chopping board setup that works with your tasks,
not actively against. Here are some things to consider when going board shopping:

## How much kitchen bench space can be used for chopping?

It's so much easier to chop and prep if there's a good deal of space on the board/s. With a big enough board you can
temporarily store *all* of your prep work on the board and add to the pot/pan whenever you need it. No bowls,
just efficiency. I feel that the more board space you setup, the less stressful the cook will be.

## Are the boards just for you or for a family or share house?

This refers to how it will be cleaned and maintained. If there can be an understanding that boards are washed
immediately after use, your options for boards remain open. If they're going to be left around, it shrinks the
option pool quite a bit.

- Left around:


### Plastic boards

Pros:
- Lightweight
- Color options to keep meat and veg prep obviously separate.

Cons:
- Less sanitary than wood. (more deep grooves from cutting, more bacteria stored.)
- Plastic chops off and goes in food.
- Slippery, probably need a tea towel underneath them.
- Boards quickly hollow out, so you can't cut straight down, and the board doesn't lay flat.
- Boards stain easily, can't be easily cleaned of said stain.

#### Plastic flexi-boards

Pros:
- Flexibility means you can fold the board and let food flow evenly into a pot or pan.

Cons:
- Same as plastic boards.

### Wooden hardwood boards

Pros:
- Quite sanitary (less deep grooves than plastic)
- Less knife dulling than other options.
- Can be refreshed/grooves removed easily through sanding.

Cons:
- Heavy, using more than a couple in a cooking session can be quite cumbersome.
- To be kept in top condition, mineral oiling on occasion is necessary.

#### Bamboo boards

Pros:
- All the good of a wooden board, now with lightweight feel!

Cons:
- Not flexible.
- Slippery, probably need a tea towel underneath them.

#### Sani-Tuff rubber boards

Pros:
- Actively anti-microbial.
- Can be sanded back like a wooden board.

Cons:
- Heavy
- Expensive.

## Winners

To me, the most practical option is the bamboo board. It's the lightest and the only compromise
is the use of a towel to stabilise while chopping. This is
